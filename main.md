# Project Title: GitWonk

**Description** Product documentations are the fundamental building blocks of any product, yet they still remain a pain point for many teams and enterprises. There is a lack of open-source alternatives that offer both Software as a Service (SaaS) and self-hosting options, as well as robust integration with third-party services such as GitLab and Bitbucket.
