# Project Title: GitWonk

Product documentations are the fundamental building blocks of any product, yet they still remain a pain point for many teams and enterprises. There is a lack of open-source alternatives that offer both Software as a Service (SaaS) and self-hosting options, as well as robust integration with third-party services such as GitLab and Bitbucket. Introducing GitWonk, a community focused an open source alternative to GitBook. We designed and built the product focusing on the developer experience from day one, providing SaaS as well as self-hosting as an option. Our emphasis is on comprehensive documentation, encompassing everything from product information to internal knowledge bases and APIs, to streamline the experience for teams and businesses. We uphold strict data policies and offer effortless integration with third-party services.
